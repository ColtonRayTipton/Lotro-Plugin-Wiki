# Welcome to the LotroAPI Repository!

I do not own rights to the documents. I am simply putting it here for another ease of access to use, and for anyone else wanting to download.

You can download the documentation [here](https://github.com/ColtonRayTipton/LotroAPI/releases/tag/v1.25.0)


# Lotro Plugin Wiki

I am making a wiki for anyone trying to learn how to make plugins for The Lord of the Rings Online. I also noticed that there was never any good explanation on anything so I am hoping I can help with the learning curve a bit.

Check out the wiki [here](https://github.com/ColtonRayTipton/LotroAPI/wiki)
